### Mission

  The objective is to make vim clean and easy to use. Without a lot of remap and plugins.

  The less the better.

### How to use it

   1. Clone this repository (git clone git@github.com:renatoperes01/vim-config.git)
   2. Go into the directory (cd vim-config)
   3. Run ./setup
   4. Let the script work.

### Commands

   * The Leader key is ',' (comma)
   * To access NERDTree type ,n for example
   * Run :map to check the mapped keys

### Important tips

   * If you know nothing about vim try the 'vimtutor'.
   * I recommend you read my vimrc and get inspired to build your own.
   * I strongly recommend you to use the keys h, j, k, l to move around.
